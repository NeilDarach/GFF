After a family man is unexpectedly hailed a hero, a sinister stranger arrives in town who claims to know him, putting his past under scrutiny and his present under threat.

Tom (Viggo Mortensen) has a cosy family life in small-town Indiana with his wife (Maria Bello) and kids Jack and Sarah (Ashton Holme and Heidi Hayes).

Samet (Deniz Celiloglu) is frustrated with his art teacher job in a rural backwater of Anatolia, where the snow falls constantly in winter. This slow-burn character study follows Samet over the course of a school year, first as his manipulations of pupil Sevim (Ece Bagci) land himself and his colleague Kenan (Musab Ekici) in hot water, then as his narcissism leads him to try and put an end to Kenan’s friendship with fellow teacher Nuray (Merve Dizdar).

Desperate to escape his mind-numbing routine, uptown Manhattan office worker Paul Hackett (Griffin Dunne) ventures downtown for a hookup with a mystery woman (Rosanna Arquette). So begins the wildest night of his life, as bizarre occurrences—involving underground-art punks, a distressed waitress, a crazed Mister Softee truck driver, and a bagel-and-cream-cheese paperweight—pile up with anxiety-inducing relentlessness and thwart his attempts to get home. The first of Scorsese’s seven collaborations with genius cinematographer Michael Ballhaus, who also shot Goodfellas and The Age of Innocence, After Hours is an often-overlooked gem from one of the greatest American filmmakers.","Griffin Dunne, Rosanna Arquette, Verna Bloom","Comedy","Crime, Drama","Martin Scorsese","15","Violence, Strong sexual references","","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZzb_6LtMjY?si=Ne0DRMn7GG7bjlQn","https://indy-systems.imgix.net/7jhs296lsgunpx2ohym59s3g873n"

"Flaming Star + Intro from Invisible Women","2024/03/02 15:00",101,"GFT 3","Don Siegel (Dirty Harry) directs Dolores del Rio and Elvis Presley in this highly entertaining Western curio about a half-Native American cattle rancher torn between communities when his Kiowan relatives return to reclaim their stolen land.

In this quirky but highly entertaining Western curio directed by Don Siegel (Dirty Harry, Escape from Alcatraz), Elvis Presley (!) stars as Pacer Burton a half-Native American Texan cattle rancher who finds his loyalties split when his Kiowan relatives return to reclaim their stolen land. Del Río is cast across ethnicities as Pacer’s mother, an Indigenous woman who has married outside her community. Like many period Westerns Flaming Star has problematic elements, but nevertheless there’s much to enjoy here, from a bracingly bleak exploration of generational colonial violence to a surprisingly effective performance from Presley. In one of her later Hollywood appearances, Del Río brings gravitas and class to proceedings.

"Flying Down to Rio + Intro from Invisible Women","2024/02/29 15:40",89,"GFT 1","
Dolores del Río plays a Brazilian aristocratic beauty caught in a love triangle in this delightfully frothy Golden Age Hollywood musical, co-starring Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers.

In this delightfully frothy Golden Age Hollywood confection, Dolores del Río stars as a Brazilian aristocratic beauty caught in a love triangle between her dubious fiance (Raul Roulien) and a dashing US band leader (Gene Raymond). Ostensibly set in Rio de Janeiro, the film presents an idealised vision of a pan-Latin paradise, but despite the stereotyping del Río’s performance sizzles with vivacity, charm and a dash of pre-code sauce. Flying Down to Rio also has the distinction of debuting the first on-screen partnership between Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers, and an extended central dance sequence is a highlight - as is the gloriously preposterous finale, an aerial ballet which unfolds on the wings of a plane.

Sexy, smooth and seductive, Nina (Nia Long) and Darius (Larenz Tate) lead the ensemble cast, but the story reverberates around them and their intoxicating romance.

When gym manager Lou (Kristen Stewart) meets bodybuilder Jackie (Katy O’Brian) as she heads through town for Las Vegas, the pair embark on a romance. But their burgeoning feelings for one another come under threat thanks to the criminal activities of Lou’s family. Rose Glass achieved critical acclaim with her chilling British-set debut Saint Maud. Here she proves equally adept at embracing small-town Americana to craft a sharply stylish thriller that packs plenty of emotional heat. Beyond the gripping central performances, Ed Harris offers menacing support as Lou’s ne’er do well father, who has attracted the attention of the FBI.

This luminous classic melodrama is a defining work of Mexico's cinematic Golden Age. In perhaps her most iconic performance, del Río plays the title character, a young Indigenous woman shunned by her people as the daughter of a sex worker, whose only protection comes from the young man who loves her (Pedro Armendáriz). The floating gardens of Mexico City’s Xochimilco district serve as a stunning backdrop for an epic tragedy. María Candelaria is one of several turbulent, but successful collaborations with the formidable director Emilio ‘El Indio’ Fernández and was the first Latin American film to win the Palme d’Or at Cannes, representing a major breakthrough for the region’s cinema on the world stage.

A sharply scripted David and Goliath crowd pleaser, directed with panache by Frank Capra, sees James Stewart’s good-hearted small-town senator refuse to be cowed by the political corruption of Washington.

James Stewart enjoyed a career of grand roles but was arguably never better than in this Oscar-nominated performance as Jefferson Smith. Frank Capra’s consideration of political corruption, meanwhile, has lost none of its potency down the years. When a senator dies mid-term, wet-behind-the-ears patriot Smith is viewed as the perfect pawn by a cynical political machine intent on driving a lucrative bill into law. The morally upstanding Smith, however, has other ideas and sets about fighting for democracy with the help of his canny-minded secretary Clarissa (Jean Arthur, sparkling).

Wit, charm and sophistication come together in impeccable fashion in this masterful romantic comedy from Ernst Lubitsch.

When the father of servant girl Rosa (Valentina Véliz Caileo) is killed by her boss, she is taken in by powerful Huilliche leader Mateo (Daniel Antivilo). In a bid for justice, his influence leads Rosa away from Christianity and towards witchcraft.

The wild and restless spirit and melodrama of Emily Brontë’s gothic romance is brought to the big screen in William Wyler’s celebrated version of the 19th century classic. A stranger’s visit to the gloomy mansion of Wuthering Heights prompts a telling of the doomed romance between Merle Oberon’s haughty Cathy and the darkly brooding Heathcliff (Laurence Olivier), whose passion for her threatens to overwhelm them both.

Mary Shelley’s classic has never been so funny or irreverent as in Mel Brooks’s charming Universal horror spoof. Gene Wilder plays the grandson of Dr Victor Frankenstein, trying to escape the scientist’s legacy after he inherits the Transylvanian estate, not least by insisting his name is pronounced “Fronkensteen”. Things, however, don’t go to plan and a monster (Peter Boyle) with a zip in his neck is soon Puttin’ on the Ritz. Wilder, who co-wrote the script with Brooks, brings a maniacal glee to the central role, while Madeline Kahn, Marty Feldman, Cloris Leachman and Teri Garr all offer hilarious support.
