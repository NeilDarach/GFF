    "synopsis": "PLEASE NOTE: this performance is free entry but tickets will only be issued from the Box Office on the day of the screening.\n\nAfter a family man is unexpectedly hailed a hero, a sinister stranger arrives in town who claims to know him, putting his past under scrutiny and his present under threat.\n\nTom (Viggo Mortensen) has a cosy family life in small-town Indiana with his wife (Maria Bello) and kids Jack and Sarah (Ashton Holme and Heidi Hayes). When Tom foils a robbery at his diner, he is hailed a hero, but the publicity sparks the arrival of a sinister stranger (Ed Harris), who claims to know him as a violent wise guy named “Joey”. David Cronenberg’s Oscar-nominated nail-biter spirals as the mystery gradually unravels with splashes of brutality and dark humour along the way. Beyond the central performances, William Hurt puts in a wonderful against-type and Oscar-nominated turn late in the film.",
