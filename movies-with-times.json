As she tries to end things, Axel begins turning into something different, something monstrous.

He opens the door to find a young woman (Jordan Cowan), alone in the night, with no explanation of how she got there. He allows her take shelter, but the paranoia of both characters begins to boil and the two begin to question each other's stories and motives as the storm outside rages.

Starring Parminder Nagra and a teenage Keira Knightley as Jess and Jules, who become fast-friends through a shared love of the ‘beautiful game’!\n\nJess is desperate to play football, but her conservative Indian Punjabi Sikh parents won’t allow it. When she’s kicking the ball around for fun, her skills are noticed by Jules, who convinces her to join her semi-pro team, the Hounslow Harriers. As Jess manages to find a way to play whilst hiding her forbidden secret from her family, she begins to develop romantic feelings for the team’s coach, Joe. At the time of its release, Gurinder Chadha’s early 2000s classic crossed cultural barriers with ease and was arguably, ahead of its time. Twenty-two years later one must ask, is the real love story between Jess and Jules?\n",

Their relationship is one of tug and war, marked by frequent uncouplings and occasional bursts of violence. Finally, one of their splits becomes permanent, but with no money Fai is unable to leave the city. He gets a job at a bar, only seeing Po-Wing from a distance until an almost-fatal incident forces the two together one final time.

Sexy, smooth and seductive, Nina (Nia Long) and Darius (Larenz Tate) lead the ensemble cast, but the story reverberates around them and their intoxicating romance. A love story about finding the one and how being reluctant to commit can be more painful than jumping right in. Writer-director Theodore Witcher’s feature debut features a stunning soundtrack, authentic performances and perfectly placed dialogue. They don’t make them like this anymore!\n\nThe film will be accompanied by a screening of short film, Essex Girls.\nDirector: Yero Timi-Biu\nUK 2023. 15 min.",

              "synopsis": "GFT’s long-running Scorsese of the Month season comes to GFF for a second year, with the UK premiere of the 4K restoration of Martin Scorsese’s darkly comic tale from 1985.\n\nDesperate to escape his mind-numbing routine, uptown Manhattan office worker Paul Hackett (Griffin Dunne) ventures downtown for a hookup with a mystery woman (Rosanna Arquette). So begins the wildest night of his life, as bizarre occurrences—involving underground-art punks, a distressed waitress, a crazed Mister Softee truck driver, and a bagel-and-cream-cheese paperweight—pile up with anxiety-inducing relentlessness and thwart his attempts to get home. The first of Scorsese’s seven collaborations with genius cinematographer Michael Ballhaus, who also shot Goodfellas and The Age of Innocence, After Hours is an often-overlooked gem from one of the greatest American filmmakers.",

Jack Archer’s elegaic and gently moving consideration of his work features contributions from the man closest to him, his best friend Peter Jewell, who talks about the life they shared for decades and Douglas’s passion for film. We Need To Talk About Kevin director Lynne Ramsay and filmmaker Lenny Abrahamson (Room) also offer insights about his enduring legacy.",

We hit the streets with over-worked and worn-out Angela (Ilinca Manolache). As she tries to organise a workplace safety video and chauffeur round her Austrian boss (Nina Hoss), her story is intercut with snippets from Ceaucescu-era film Angela Moves On, about a female taxi driver (Dorina Lazar). Jude skewers everything from toxic masculinity to the gig economy, drawing parallels between then and now, while craftily bringing the two Angelas together. German director Uwe Boll also makes a delightfully anarchic appearance as himself.\n\nRomanian with English subtitles",

We hit the streets with over-worked and worn-out Angela (Ilinca Manolache). As she tries to organise a workplace safety video and chauffeur round her Austrian boss (Nina Hoss), her story is intercut with snippets from Ceaucescu-era film Angela Moves On, about a female taxi driver (Dorina Lazar). Jude skewers everything from toxic masculinity to the gig economy, drawing parallels between then and now, while craftily bringing the two Angelas together. German director Uwe Boll also makes a delightfully anarchic appearance as himself.\n\nRomanian with English subtitles",

Soon Matias’ lover Enni (Oona Airola) is part of their lives and things become more emotionally complex when Juulia takes on a non-binary partner, Miska (Pietu Wikström).

A tale of intrigue that offers plenty to unearth.      \n                                              \nItalian and English with English subtitles.",

But their burgeoning feelings for one another come under threat thanks to the criminal activities of Lou’s family. Rose Glass achieved critical acclaim with her chilling British-set debut Saint Maud. Here she proves equally adept at embracing small-town Americana to craft a sharply stylish thriller that packs plenty of emotional heat. Beyond the gripping central performances, Ed Harris offers menacing support as Lou’s ne’er do well father, who has attracted the attention of the FBI. ",

But the inventive teacher refuses to be beaten. He ditches fact-based learning and adopts unorthodox methods to help unlock the students’ true potential and encourage them to think for themselves. Winner of the Festival Favourite award with audiences at Sundance, Christopher Zalla’s inspirational tale is a celebration of dedication and achievement in the face of adversity.  Zalla handles this moving and uplifting Mexican true story with a light touch, plenty of humour and a lot of heart.\n\nSpanish with English subtitles",

              "synopsis": "A teacher uses unconventional methods to inspire his students in a warm-hearted true story that strikes a hopeful note without shying away from the societal struggle faced by many young people. \n\nCrime, violence and poverty mean a teacher (Eugenio Derbez) faces a tough challenge when he takes on a class full of under-performing 12-year-olds. But the inventive teacher refuses to be beaten. He ditches fact-based learning and adopts unorthodox methods to help unlock the students’ true potential and encourage them to think for themselves. Winner of the Festival Favourite award with audiences at Sundance, Christopher Zalla’s inspirational tale is a celebration of dedication and achievement in the face of adversity.  Zalla handles this moving and uplifting Mexican true story with a light touch, plenty of humour and a lot of heart.\n\nSpanish with English subtitles",

A tragedy in the local canal leaves 12-year-old James (Wiliam Eadie) haunted by his part in it but there’s little room for sentimentality as ma (Mandy Matthews), da (Tommy Flannagan) and sisters struggle to get by. Ramsay, in the spirit of Bill Douglas and Terence Davies, captures the brutality and tough love of life on the breadline while still showing childhood contains moments of unexpected wonder. Gritty and realistic but full of humanity.",

Is it a sleep disorder, or something more supernatural? As Jason Yu turns the screw in this nerve-jangling horror, Soo-jin becomes increasingly paranoid and sleepless as she fears what will happen during the night.\n \nKorean with English Subtitles.",

When Black Sabbath-loving young soldier Rafael (Ursel Tilk) has a brush with death invovling three Chinese martial artists and a boombox, he decides to become a kung-fu Orthodox monk. But the path to humility is not as easy as it looks, especially in the face of rival monk Irinei (Kaarel Pogga), the attractions of local woman Rita (Ester Kuntu) and his mum’s home cooking. Sarnet blends flamboyant kick-ass action with absurdist humour.     \n                                    \nEstonian and Russian with English subtitles.",

              "synopsis": "Heavy metal and kung-fu comedy come together with anarchic absurdity in this tale of a soldier whose brush with death leads him to decide to become a martial arts monk.\n\nThe colourful exuberance and dodgy fashions of the 1970s are perfectly captured in Rainer Sarnet’s anarchic kung-fu comedy. When Black Sabbath-loving young soldier Rafael (Ursel Tilk) has a brush with death invovling three Chinese martial artists and a boombox, he decides to become a kung-fu Orthodox monk. But the path to humility is not as easy as it looks, especially in the face of rival monk Irinei (Kaarel Pogga), the attractions of local woman Rita (Ester Kuntu) and his mum’s home cooking. Sarnet blends flamboyant kick-ass action with absurdist humour.     \n                                    \nEstonian and Russian with English subtitles.",

They are awaiting their patriarch’s return, though he warned them not to let him enter after more than six days as he would have become a shroud and blood-sucking Vourdalak. When the day arrives, familial love could prove deadly. Mixing gothic horror with a Hammer vibe - enhanced by Super 16 film - the use of a marionette as the Vourdalak adds to the eerie retro quality. Adrien Beau’s Leo Tolstoy adaptation offers a deliciously macabre twist on the vampire genre.\n\nFrench with English subtitles.",

They are awaiting their patriarch’s return, though he warned them not to let him enter after more than six days as he would have become a shroud and blood-sucking Vourdalak. When the day arrives, familial love could prove deadly. Mixing gothic horror with a Hammer vibe - enhanced by Super 16 film - the use of a marionette as the Vourdalak adds to the eerie retro quality. Adrien Beau’s Leo Tolstoy adaptation offers a deliciously macabre twist on the vampire genre.\n\nFrench with English subtitles.",

Ostensibly set in Rio de Janeiro, the film presents an idealised vision of a pan-Latin paradise, but despite the stereotyping del Río’s performance sizzles with vivacity, charm and a dash of pre-code sauce. Flying Down to Rio also has the distinction of debuting the first on-screen partnership between Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers, and an extended central dance sequence is a highlight - as is the gloriously preposterous finale, an aerial ballet which unfolds on the wings of a plane.\n\nEnglish and Portuguese with English subtitles.\n\nThis screening will be introduced by Invisible Women.\nWith thanks to the BBC",

              "synopsis": "In this delicious noir, del Río delivers double the star power in an alluring dual role playing twins - one a vivacious young widow and the other a downtrodden manicurist who develops a dangerous jealousy of her successful sister.\n\nDowntrodden manicurist Maria is struggling with mounting debts and sleazy customers, while vivacious young widow Magdalena lives in casual luxury after the death of her millionaire husband. As the gulf between the sisters' lives grows, Maria’s jealousy begins to spiral dangerously out of control. After a successful spell in Hollywood, del Río had grown weary of playing exotic bombshells and returned to Mexico to seek out meatier parts. La Otra brings del Río together with Roberto Gavaldón, a key Mexican Golden Age filmmaker famed for his larger-than-life melodramas. \n\nSpanish with English Subtitles.\n\nThis screening will be introduced by Invisible Women.\nWith thanks to Filmoteca UNAM and the estate of Roberto Gavaldón Arbide",

              "synopsis": "This luminous melodrama was the first Latin American film to win the Palme d’Or. Dolores del Río stars in her most iconic role, as a young Indigenous woman shunned by her community due to social stigma.\n\nThis luminous classic melodrama is a defining work of Mexico's cinematic Golden Age. In perhaps her most iconic performance, del Río plays the title character, a young Indigenous woman shunned by her people as the daughter of a sex worker, whose only protection comes from the young man who loves her (Pedro Armendáriz). The floating gardens of Mexico City’s Xochimilco district serve as a stunning backdrop for an epic tragedy. María Candelaria is one of several turbulent, but successful collaborations with the formidable director Emilio ‘El Indio’ Fernández and was the first Latin American film to win the Palme d’Or at Cannes, representing a major breakthrough for the region’s cinema on the world stage. \n\nSpanish with English subtitles.\n\nThis screening will be introduced by Invisible Women.\nWith thanks to Televisa",
