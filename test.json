Ódinn (Jóhannes Haukur Jóhannesson) and his daughter Rún (Jóhannesson’s daughter in real-life Ólöf Halla Jóhannesdóttir, making an impressive debut) are struggling to come to terms with her mother’s suicide. As Ódinn starts to investigate historic deaths at a juvenile centre, director Erlingur Thoroddsen transports us back to see events unfold between the sadistic centre owners, their employee Aldís (Elín Hall) and their young charges. Soon Ódinn begins to suspect the past may be connected to the present.\n\nIcelandic with English subtitles.",
